With {{estimatedSubbies}} subbies, you're probably processing 200-300 certificates a year. At 20-30 minutes each (download, open, check, log, follow up) - that's 100+ hours of admin work annually.

We've got builders doing that same volume where their team spends maybe 2 hours a month reviewing exceptions. The rest is handled.
